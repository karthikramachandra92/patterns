# Mockable Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

## 🎯 Objective
Develop a HAL with mock/stub support for testing on PC or CI systems.

## 🛠️ What You’ll Implement
- GPIO, I2C, SPI interfaces
- Hardware vs. mock backend
- Interface-based API design

## ⭐ Bonus
- Add event simulation in mocks
- Inject test faults (e.g., NACK, bus errors)
